# Assignment

### Thank you team Script Assist, this was a fun build for me.
The project is made on top of swapi ( star wars api ) and covers all the assignment pointers. Since the assignment pointers allowed flexibility to probably gauge my design thinking and thought process. I've taken some creative liberty, apologies if something was supposed to be done another way.

### Pointers for assignment:
- I've used a theme of blue/ yellow to match the star wars theme. I wanted this to look as starwary as possible and you'll see it at small small places as well :)
- ```Authentication Mechanism``` I wanted to be a little creative with implementing this. Usually auth is for keeping user specific details, since this is like a public api thing but assignment asked for it I wanted to implement it like it's in a real world scenario. I think seeing sign in/ sign up at the start is old now and I believe the UI should ask signin/signup when personalization of user specific data comes in picture. So i've implemented it just before the ResourceDetail page. 
- ```Resource List Page``` This is also done in the file Resource.tsx showing all the resources swapi api has to offer.
- ```Resource Detail Page``` This is also done in the file with the same name.
- ```Deep Linking``` Used every where in the project for navigation
- Along with the provided stack I've used tailwind css for animations and customizations mostly.
- I've also added search functionality to query for a particular individual resource
- Firebase is used for auth. Since I didn't want to add classic email/password. Google Auth is quick ( this was again my assumption, apologies if you wanted email/password too)
- I've made use of good coding principles thoughout for an unclutterd codebase. If any thing can be improved please let me know!
- The project is also responsive throughout for screens, although improvements can be done :)

Here's the deployed link of the project for you to see the final UI without running it locally (since I won't be sharing firebaseconfig.json on github). Although if you want to run it locally you can do it by connecting it with your own firebase account.

I hope this meets the coding standards, do give me feedbackðŸ™Œ
